    "We went to a state level government website to find which power plants in Ohio use biomass in order to generate electricity. We were able to find metrics such as power capacity of the plant at any given time (Pi,m) (in MW) and were able to calculate the maximum amount of electricity (in MWh) for a plant running at full capacity. Lastly, we used data/metrics given about the generators at each plant to determine the ramp up/ramp down costs for each plant. Also, we weren't able to find specific labor and maintenance costs for each plant, so we researched the average labor and maintenance costs in a year. And in order to determine the monthly demand for electricity (in MWh), we used the estimated number of households in Minerva Park multiplied by the average number of KWhs used per household on a monthly basis in order to determine the entire city’s monthly electrical demand.\n"
